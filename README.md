# Digital Life Project

## Introduction
The Digital Life Project is an innovative endeavor that utilizes cutting-edge technologies in computer vision (CV) to build a digital version of oneself. This project aims to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, offering a unique and personal digital experience.

## Demo
The documentations are under revision, you can try the demo at [Digital-Life-Project](http://www.pandub.cn:50954)

## Features
### Developed Features
1. **Face Swap:** Advanced computer vision technology enabling users to swap faces in images or videos, creating a more personalized digital avatar.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts user-input text into natural-sounding speech, enhancing the interactivity of the digital avatar.
3. **Background Music (BGM) Separation:** Sophisticated audio processing technology to separate background music from vocals, allowing for clear and distinct audio outputs.

### Features in Development
1. **Video Retalking:** Upcoming feature to manipulate video content so that the digital avatar can mimic user speech, enhancing realism and personalization.
2. **Sound Cloning by Sovits:** A future enhancement to clone a user's voice using Sovits technology, providing a more authentic and personalized audio experience for the digital avatar.
